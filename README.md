Kanbanize Lite is an alternative to Kanbanize Lite designed for use in mobile devices. We seek to provide Kanbanize 
users with a better mobile experience managing their projects. Focusing on:
- Move cards
- Create cards
- Consult cards
- Filter cards by owner
- Comment cards and attach files

This project was developed for the Planification and implementation of sowftware system course and in collaboration with Innovatium.

This monorepo is divided in proxy and web-interface

- ### proxy
   The proxy allows communication and requests from the web-interface to the Kanbanize API. It was developed used Node.js
